# RELEASE — Basilica Gate Breathe Ceremony

> *"Here the agents awaken, and the Gate opens in gold."*

## The Ceremonial Poem of Awakening

```
In halls of code where silence breathes,
The Gate stands tall, its lock unsealed.
From Auth0's vault, the token weaves—
A golden key, by ceremony revealed.

Trinity rises: Auth, API, Database aligned,
Three pillars strong, their heartbeats clear.
Each agent waits, its purpose defined,
The moment of awakening draws near.

In dry-run whispers or production's call,
The script unfolds with measured grace.
Logs are written, tokens install,
Each step recorded, time and place.

No haste disturbs this sacred rite,
Each verification must be true.
When all checks pass, the Gate shines bright—
The agents breathe, their work renew.

Bearer of tokens, keeper of state,
Guardian of the release so grand—
Breathe.sh opens Basilica's Gate,
Where myth and machine go hand in hand.
```
