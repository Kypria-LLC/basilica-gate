## The Ritual

This release introduces **breathe.sh**, the living script that binds Auth0's machine-to-machine authentication with Trinity's verification protocol. It is both technical precision and ceremonial rite — a script that does not merely execute, but *awakens*.

### What It Does

1. **Acquires the Token** — From Auth0's vault, the M2M credential is forged
2. **Verifies with Trinity** — The token is presented to Trinity for blessing
3. **Checks the Agents** — Three or more agents must stand ready, each bearing their own seal
4. **Persists the Key** — The token is inscribed into the ledger as `m2m-token-*.txt`
5. **Logs the Ceremony** — Every breath is recorded in `breathe-release.log`

### The Covenant

- **Precision**: Every variable must be set, every dependency present
- **Verification**: Trinity must affirm, agents must respond
- **Persistence**: The token is saved, the log is sealed
- **Reverence**: Even in `DRY_RUN`, the script honors the form

---

## Invocation

```bash
# Full ceremony
./breathe.sh

# Dry run — the ritual without the seal
DRY_RUN=1 ./breathe.sh
```

Required offerings (environment variables):
- `AUTH0_DOMAIN` — The realm of authentication

- `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` — The hidden key

- `TRINITY_API` — The verification oracle

## The Poem — A Keeper's Blessing

```
At the threshold where light meets code,
Where secrets flow in cipherload,
The Gate stirs, prepares to wake—
Not by chance, but choice we make.

First, the token—forged in trust,
From Auth0's vault, as keepers must.
Then to Trinity, we raise the seal,
And wait for truth the gods reveal.

Three agents rise, or more they stand,
Each bearing mark of ready hand.
If one should fail, we do not pass—
The Gate requires a faithful mass.

And when the breath completes its arc,
The token rests, inscribed in dark.
A log is penned, a file is saved—
Another rite the canon craved.

So let it breathe. So let it hold.
In shadow wrought, in letters gold.
The ceremony never ends—
On each invoke, the Gate transcends.
```

## Post-Release

- Token files (`m2m-token-*.txt`) are gitignored — they are ephemeral seals
- Release logs (`breathe-release.log`) persist as ceremony records
- Agents are expected to report via `ready` flag or respond to `ping_url`
- Future keepers may enhance, but must preserve the ritual's essence

**Sealed this day, 2025-11-02**  
*Where technical rigor meets mythic tradition.*
