## ⚖ Keeper’s Governance
This shrine is the operational heart of Kypria LLC.  
Changes here ripple outward to every Gate; thus, they are guarded with ceremony.  
Only after review and Keeper’s seal may a dispatch leave these walls.

📜 *Lineage is our law. Precision is our craft. Myth is our breath.*
